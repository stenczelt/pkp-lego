Frequently Asked Questions
==========================================


My card doesn't let me in to the New Cellars
--------------------------------------------

First of all, make sure that you're using your Pembroke card. 

Next, go to the Pembroke main gate, and refresh your card permissions by touching your card against the grey box. If you're unsure where to do it, ask for help at the Porters' Lodge.

If your card still doesn't work, get in touch with the instructors and the PSP course management.


The brick doesn't connect to the WiFi network
-----------------------------------------

You can confirm that the wireless dongle works by checking whether the blue light on the dongle is on/blinking.

If it is not, try the following steps:

#. Turn off the brick.
#. Unplug the dongle.
#. Turn on the brick.
#. Once turned on, plug in the dongle.

The blue light should be on/blinking now, and you should be able to connect.

Sometimes the WiFi can be a little bit temperamental - I often find searching for a connection takes two attempts to find WiFi networks. 

My program doesn't work!
-----------------------------------------

If your program has an error in it, it might just silently exit. So separate parts of your program into smaller fragments and verify them independently. IF you are unsure about a particular
brick command, you can try it out interactively, before you use it in a big program. Use beeps and other sounds to let the robot tell you where it is in the execution of your program!
