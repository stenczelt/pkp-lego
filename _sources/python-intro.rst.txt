Python Introduction
==========================================

Python is a generic programming language, and we can use it to program the EV3 LEGO brick.  If you have used python before, you can skip this section, and go straight to the next one to learn how to connect to the LEGO brick. 

If you have not programmed before, you need a crash course. There are many online, and we recommend https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/python/ . It is very short, and starts very simple. At first, focus on the early parts and don't worry too much about the sections beyond "6. Classes". 


Exercises
--------------


  *Task:* Generate a two random arrays of size :math:`n` each of integers between 1 and 6 (corresponding to :math:`n` throws of two dice) and determine the histogram of the sum of the dice throws. 

  *Task:* Implement a Low-Pass Filter as described in the :doc:`ev3-sensors` page.
