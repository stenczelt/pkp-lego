EV3 Motors Introduction
===========================================

The EV3 python interface provides a collection of functions to read sensors and control motors. Here, we will go through an introduction to motor control.



Prerequisites
-------------

This part of the tutorial assumes that you connected to the EV3 in interactive mode, via SSH. Complete the :doc:`ev3-setup` section before proceeding.

Attach one of the big motors to Port A on the brick, the other one to Port B, and the third small motor to Port C. The motors always need to be attached to the ports marked with letters.

Initialise 
----------

Once connected to the brick, launch the built-in python interpreter
::
	brickrun -r -- pybricks-micropython

Then import some python functions
::
	from pybricks.hubs import EV3Brick
	from pybricks.ev3devices import Motor
	from pybricks.parameters import Port


Create a brick object: 
::
	ev3 = EV3Brick()

And then a motor object. Notice how you need to specify the port it is connected to. 
::
	m = Motor(Port.A)
	
If you specify a port with no motor connected, you get an error. Try it!

Now we can issue commands
::
	m.run(200)

This gets the motor going at a speed of 200 degrees (of angle) per second. We get the command prompt back, and can continue to do things, while the motor keeps running. In order to stop it, we can issue another command
::
	m.stop()

Try all your motors. Run them simultaneously. 

Speed control
--------------

Play around with different motor speeds. At very low speed, the motor will stutter, because of friction.  Find the smallest speed at which your motor turns reliably. If you want something to turn very slowly but steadily, you will need to build a **gearbox**, i.e. run the motor faster, but have it connect to a small gear then a large gear, so the latter turns more slowly.

Many ways to stop
------------------

There are several ways to stop a motor. You can just stop applying power to it entirely, or you can also break by counteractive the voltage generated as the motor turns a bit due to its angular momentum. This latter functionality is available via the function
::
	m.brake()

There is an even more controlled way, which actively holds the motor position at the place where it was when you issue the command. The motor remains under power, so e.g. it can hold a weight that is being lifted. You can attach an arm to the motor and weight the end with antoher piece to see the difference. Make sure that there is space for the arm to fully turn, otherwise you risk breaking pieces. 
::
	m.hold()

When you use the `hold` function, you can see that the motor cannot be turned by hand. To release, use a `stop` command. 

Tachometer
-----------

As you can now tell, motor function is a bit more complicated than just "go" and "stop". In order to help us control the robot, it often helps to have an accurate picture of the state it is in, for example, just how far did the motors **actually** turn. We can access this information using the following function called
::
	m.angle()

which reports the angle (in degrees) through which the motor has turned. We can reset the value of this internal angle sensor at any time using
::
	m.reset_angle()

Writing programs
-----------------

Now instead of using the brick interactively, write a simple program into the "main.py" file of a new project that moves a motor by a small amount. Download this program onto the brick and run it. In order to run downloaded programs, you will need to browse for them using the keys on the brick, and navigate to "main.py". 

Further information
-------------------

The motors can do many more things than what is given on this page. VSCode has a link to the User Guide, which you can access from the Mindstorm <o> tab by selecting "Open user guide". Motors and sensors are discussed under the "ev3devices" section of the PYBRICKS MODULES heading.
