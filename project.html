<h2>Overview<a class="headerlink" href="#overview" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>The group project you’ll be doing will span three weeks, and you’ll be working in a team of two people. A project of this size requires proper planning to make sure that you achieve your goals and don’t get behind schedule.</p>
<p>You can share your reports and other files with the instructors and the rest of the group in <a class="reference external" href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1H8qhSu2D62Y_FxDHNEdpgCOuPqFCQ4ko">this Google Drive folder</a>.</p>

<h2>Choosing a Project<a class="headerlink" href="#choosing-a-project" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>Since you don’t yet have experience with constructing and programming Mindstorms robots, it might feel difficult to tell what a project with the right size is. In order to engage the size and complexity of robot building projects, search YouTube for <em>EV3</em> (or for the older version, <em>NXT</em>), and check out the example projects below. Searching YouTube is also a good way to come up with project ideas. (Beware that some of the more spectacular projects on YouTube would require more lego kit, and more time to build and program than what you have available here)</p>
<p>Project suggestions:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Measure the <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_acceleration">gravitational acceleration</a> <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(g\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>Climb the stairs.</p></li>
<li><p>Follow a line as fast as possible.</p></li>
<li><p>Build a weight-measuring scale.</p></li>
<li><p>Find a way out of a (small/simple) labyrinth.</p></li>
<li><p>Locate a target and throw objects at/into it.</p></li>
<li><p>Avoid light.</p></li>
<li><p>Play tic-tac-toe (ambitious but definitely possible)</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Feel free to discuss your ideas and the project suggestions with the instructors.</p>
<p>Please <em>do not</em> choose a project with detailed build instructions from LEGO or elsewhere. You would be missing the fun of designing your own machine!</p>
<p>As you’re making a decision, discuss your ideas with the instructors to make sure that you’re choosing a project of the right complexity. <strong>Get your project idea signed off by the instructors.</strong></p>
<p>Finally, a tip: make sure both of you find the project exciting - that will help you concentrate throughout the course and fight the obstacles you’ll encounter.</p>

<section id="project-milestones">
<h2>Project Milestones<a class="headerlink" href="#project-milestones" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>When planning a project, it is impossible to predict exactly how much one can achieve in the given time frame. In order to deal with this uncertainty, we will work with <em>milestones</em> in this course.</p>
<p>Imagine that your project is to measure <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(g\)</span>, this will be our example here. This is a single goal, and because of the uncertainty of the many components required to build this project, you might not be able to complete the project on time, or the opposite, you might finish a week too early.</p>
<p>Thus, instead of setting a single goal, we will set several milestones that you can work towards. For the gravitational acceleration project, example milestones might be:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Build a robot to drop a ball.</p></li>
<li><p>Add sensors that register when the ball passes them.</p></li>
<li><p>Compute the gravitational acceleration from a single measurement.</p></li>
<li><p>Compute the gravitational acceleration from several manual measurements.</p></li>
<li><p>Build a construct that automatically performs several measurements.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>These milestones are great because:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>the first milestone is easy to achieve, so you can make sure you will definitely have built something by the end of the course;</p></li>
<li><p>the middle milestones are substantial and interesting projects;</p></li>
<li><p>the last milestones are extensions that make your project even more advanced.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>As part of your project plan, set some milestones. Also include an estimate of when you plan to be ready with each milestone. (Don’t worry, we’ll revisit the time estimates each week.) <strong>Make sure that you submit and get your milestones signed off by the instructors.</strong></p>
<p>Note that the primary purpose of plans is not to follow them word by word, but rather to give you a mental model of how you’re doing with your project. In this spirit, you should regularly revisit your milestones to understand whether you’re project is tracking and to see where you should alter your plan.</p>
</section>
<section id="final-report-and-presentation">
<h2>Final Report and Presentation<a class="headerlink" href="#final-report-and-presentation" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>You will finish the course by preparing a final project report and presenting your work to the rest of the class. <strong>You will be graded based on attendance, your report, and your presentation.</strong></p>
<p>The format of the final report is not specified, but at a minimum, it should include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Your original plan and what you achieved of it</p></li>
<li><p>Documentation of your final construct (the mechanical architecture and the working of the program)</p></li>
<li><p>The challenges you encountered and the design decisions you made; the evolution of your construct and program</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li><p>This is a really important part of the report: it shows that you thought about your decisions and you learnt from what you observed. Did you have a construct that didn’t work the first time, that was inaccurate the second time, but worked the third time? Did you have some code which returned noisy signal the first time but a transformation has fixed it? Write about it: the learning process is the most interesting part.</p></li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Upload your report to <a class="reference external" href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1tSt9ut87khOBa6fGmI5B59QXAmYQhGk4?usp=sharing">this shared Google Drive folder</a>.</p>
<p>The presentation will consist of 5 minutes of presentation (including a live demo of your robot) and 2 minutes of Q&amp;A.</p>
